STAGE 1: BIOMES

The goal of this stage is to determine what biome should exist where.
Each biome will have a list of possible neighboring biomes that it can be

For example, say we are trying to build a new plot of land.  Its neighbors currently are OCEAN and GRASSLAND
the odds that the tile is any one of those things might be something like
75% GRASSLAND
20% WATER
3% SNOW
2% DESERT

We should be able to add our own biases toward certain things to get the kind of map we want.

Grasslands and oceans are the most variable to change biomes as they have the most options.\
Loot tables for the biomes will likely be necessary
